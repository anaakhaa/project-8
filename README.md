CONTEXTIQ : AN ADVANCED FRAMEWORK FOR CONTEXTUAL 
ANALYSIS AND RISK DETECTION 

**Abstract**

In the digital era, accurately interpreting sentiment and emotional tone in text has become 
increasingly challenging, particularly when irony and sarcasm obscure true intent. Traditional 
sentiment analysis models often misclassify statements due to their reliance on surface-level 
sentiment classification, leading to misleading interpretations. To address this limitation, we introduce 
a Context-Aware System that integrates emotion detection, irony recognition, hate speech and 
harassment detection, named entity recognition (NER), and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Unlike 
conventional approaches, this system analyses multiple linguistic and contextual factors to provide a 
deeper and more accurate understanding of textual sentiment. 
A key innovation of this system is the Contextual Harm Score (CHS), which quantifies the potential 
misleading or harmful impact of a given text by evaluating its sentiment, irony, and contextual 
references. This feature makes the system particularly valuable for social media monitoring, content 
moderation, misinformation detection, and brand sentiment tracking. What sets this system apart is its 
ability to analyze text with contextual depth, considering named entities (e.g., people, organizations, 
locations) and grammatical structure to assess the real-world impact of statements rather than just 
their surface meaning. It is designed for domain flexibility, making it suitable for prototype-level 
experimentation across different text types, including social media posts, news snippets, and 
conversational language. 
This system leverages pretrained transformer models sourced from the Hugging Face repository, such 
as BERT and RoBERTa, which are finetuned for specific tasks like emotion detection, irony 
classification, hate speech and harassment detection, named entity recognition and employs Stanza 
for accurate part-of-speech (POS) tagging to capture syntactic structure and grammatical context. 
This integration enables the system to identify nuanced patterns of bias and discrimination with 
contextual relevance, thereby enhancing social sensitivity in textual analysis. 
A user-friendly Streamlit interface brings these capabilities to life through an interactive and visually 
rich experience. It supports real-time input analysis, offers modular subcomponent breakdowns for 
greater interpretability, and features dynamic visualizations such as trend plots to reveal underlying 
patterns. Additionally, it includes Excel export options for seamless data reporting and archival. 
Complementing there is also professionally designed demo dashboard structure, crafted to simulate 
future integration scenarios across diverse application domains. This streamlined interface ensures 
both scalability and accessibility, making it highly adaptable for developers, researchers, and 
policymakers alike.
