CONTEXTIQ : AN ADVANCED FRAMEWORK FOR CONTEXTUAL 
ANALYSIS AND RISK DETECTION 

**Abstract**

In the digital era, interpreting sentiment and emotional tone in text is challenging, especially with irony and sarcasm obscuring intent. Traditional models often misclassify text due to surface-level analysis, leading to inaccuracies. To address this, we present a Context-Aware System that integrates emotion detection, irony recognition, hate speech detection, named entity recognition (NER), and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for deeper, context-rich sentiment analysis.

A key feature is the Contextual Harm Score (CHS), which evaluates the potential harmful impact of text by analyzing sentiment, irony, and context, making it ideal for social media monitoring, content moderation, and misinformation detection. By considering contextual depth, named entities, and grammatical structure, the system provides real-world insights beyond surface meaning and is adaptable for various text types, including social media, news, and conversational language.

The system leverages finetuned transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa from Hugging Face, alongside Stanza for POS tagging, to identify nuanced patterns of bias and discrimination. A Streamlit interface offers real-time analysis, modular breakdowns, dynamic visualizations, and Excel export options, ensuring usability for developers, researchers, and policymakers. A demo dashboard structure further illustrates potential integrations across diverse applications, enhancing accessibility and scalability.
